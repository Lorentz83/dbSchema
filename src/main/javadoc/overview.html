        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>only read and write grants, currently it is impossible to distinguish
                between update, insert and delete;</li>
        </ul>

            TODO:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement selectivity.
                For the purposes of this project, selectivity does not have to be very accurate, but it is important that
                its error is consistent among different executions.
                The idea is to have a rough evaluation of the percentage of data returned for every table in the query.</li>
            <li>Implement views.</li>
            <li>Update tables.</li>
            <li>Names should be case sensitive according to the dbvendor.</li>
        </ul>
